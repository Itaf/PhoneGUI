# PhoneGUI

This program has classes that implement the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of a phone, but there's no underlying model. To remedy this, a class named Phone is defined. Instances of this class store a contact list of phone numbers (use an ArrayList). Note that this program is incomplete.
